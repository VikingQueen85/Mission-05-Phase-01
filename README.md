# Mission 5 Phase 1 Readme

This repository contains the foundational codebase for mission-5-phase-1-individual. This project represents **Phase 1** of its development, focusing on establishing the core architecture, essential development environment, and initial functionalities. It serves as a robust starting point for building a comprehensive web application designed to manage product listings.

## Installation

This project uses **npm** (Node Package Manager) for dependency management and running development scripts.

To get the project up and running on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
    cd [YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to Frontend Directory:**
    The project is structured with separate frontend and backend directories. Navigate into the frontend part of the application:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Install all the necessary packages for the frontend application:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Configure Frontend Environment Variables (if applicable):**
    If your frontend requires environment variables (e.g., for API base URLs, API keys), create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and populate it as per your project's needs. A common example:
    ```
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

5.  **Navigate to Backend Directory:**
    Open a **new terminal window** and navigate into the backend part of the application:
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    ```

6.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Install all the necessary packages for the backend application:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

7.  **Configure Backend Environment Variables:**
    In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file and add your database connection string, port, and any other required variables. Example:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
    PORT=5000
    ```
    *Ensure your MongoDB instance is running or accessible.*

8.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Run the backend server. This will typically start the API service.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    You should see a message indicating the server is running (e.g., "Server running on port 5000"). Keep this terminal window open.

9.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    Switch back to your frontend terminal window and start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will compile your React application and usually open it automatically in your default web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5173`).

## More Details

### Project Overview
This project, **Mission 5 Phase 1**, lays the groundwork for a scalable web application. It establishes a robust development environment, defines the core architectural patterns, and implements initial features to demonstrate the full-stack integration. The primary goal of this phase was to ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend, and to set up a maintainable project structure for future development.

### Key Features (Phase 1)
* **User Interface Foundation:** A basic, responsive frontend layout built with React, demonstrating initial navigation and component rendering.
* **API Endpoints:** Fundamental RESTful API endpoints on the backend for [e.g., "retrieving initial data," "user registration," "basic resource management"].
* **Database Connectivity:** Successful connection and interaction with a MongoDB database for data persistence.
* **Environment Configuration:** Robust handling of environment variables for secure and flexible deployment (e.g., database URIs, API keys, port numbers).
* **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Properly configured CORS policies to allow communication between the frontend and backend development servers.
* **Development Workflow:** Streamlined development process using `npm` scripts and tools like `nodemon` for automatic server restarts.

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend
* **React.js:** A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
* **React Router DOM:** For client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views without full page reloads.
* **Vite:** For bundling and optimizing frontend assets.
* **Axios (or native `fetch` API):** For making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend API.
* **CSS / CSS Modules:** For styling the application's visual presentation.

#### Backend
* **Node.js:** A powerful JavaScript runtime environment for server-side logic.
* **Express.js:** A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to build the RESTful API endpoints.
* **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, simplifying database interactions and schema definition.
* **`dotenv`:** For managing environment variables securely.
* **`cors`:** Middleware to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, crucial for frontend-backend communication in development.
* **`nodemon`:** A utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server, speeding up development.

#### Database
* **MongoDB:** A flexible, NoSQL document database used for storing application data.

### Architecture Overview

The application is structured as a standard **Client-Server architecture**:

* **Frontend (React.js Application):**
    * Runs in the user's web browser.
    * Responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user interactions, and making asynchronous requests to the backend API to fetch or send data.
    * Manages client-side routing and responsiveness to ensure an optimal experience across various devices.
* **Backend (Node.js/Express.js API):**
    * Runs on a server (your local machine during development).
    * Provides a **RESTful API** that the frontend consumes.
    * Handles business logic, processes requests from the frontend, interacts with the database, and serves data back as JSON responses.
* **Database (MongoDB):**
    * A separate data store that the backend connects to.
    * Persistently stores all application data, ensuring data is saved and retrieved reliably.

### Usage

Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, you can access the application through your web browser. Interact with the UI to trigger API calls and observe data being fetched and displayed.

### Future Enhancements (Roadmap for subsequent phases)

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Implement full user login, registration, and role-based access control.
* **Advanced CRUD Operations:** Expand API and frontend capabilities for creating, updating, and deleting various resources.
* **Enhanced UI/UX:** Implement more sophisticated styling, animations, and interactive elements.
* **Error Handling & Validation:** More robust error handling on both frontend and backend, with comprehensive input validation.
* **Testing:** Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for both frontend and backend.
* **Deployment Automation:** Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
